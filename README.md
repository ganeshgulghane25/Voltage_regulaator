Linear & Variable Voltage Regulator (7805 + LM317)

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of two power supply circuits: a fixed 5V linear voltage regulator using the 7805 IC, and a variable voltage regulator using the LM317 IC. Both Proteus simulations and real hardware builds are included to show the complete workflow from circuit design to practical testing.

🔌 1. 7805 Fixed Voltage Regulator

A simple linear regulator circuit that provides a stable 5V DC output.
It uses:

Step-down transformer

Bridge rectifier

Filter capacitor

7805 voltage regulator

Load indicator (LED + resistor)

This circuit converts AC into smooth, regulated 5V DC, ideal for powering microcontrollers and digital circuits.

🔧 2. LM317 Variable Voltage Regulator

A flexible regulator that provides adjustable output from 1.25V to 12V or more.




This makes LM317 useful for testing, prototyping, and powering circuits requiring different voltage levels.

🖥️ Simulation

Proteus simulations include:

AC to DC conversion

Rectification and filtering

7805 regulation

LM317 adjustable output

Voltage monitoring using meters

Load indication using LEDs

(You can add screenshots in the /screenshots folder.)

🛠️ Hardware Implementation

The real hardware version uses the same components as the simulation. The circuit is tested on a breadboard/PCB and measured using a multimeter to verify the regulated output.
